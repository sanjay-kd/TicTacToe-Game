# TicTacToe-Game
#### SinglePlayer &amp; Mulitplayer Java Game

You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think!

Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.

## Game Rules 

The rules of tic tac toe are fairly straightforward. Below is a comprehensive list of the noughts and crosses game rules:

* The game requires two players, X and O.
* The game board is a set 3x3 grid in which players will place their symbol to claim that segment.
* X typically players first, then players alternate turns.
* The goal is to claim three segments of the grid in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* No additional sides can be added to the grid.
* The game is over either when one player achieves three segments in a row, or when the grid is filled without anyone achieving three segments in a row.
* While these rules are easy to understand, the game has the potential to produce 26,830 different variations, but that includes all identical rotations and mirror images of each board. When those repetitions are removed, there are a total of 765 different outcomes for the grid.
